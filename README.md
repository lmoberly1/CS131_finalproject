## Beatboard

Uses Canny Edge detection to locate a grid of squares and shapes on the grid.
Each grid square corresponds to a musical intonation (vertical) and a beat in a standard 4-beat measure (horizontal).
Three shapes can be placed in a grid square and will produce a musical note from their corresponding instrument.

## Trombone

Uses hand detection to calculate distance between hands.
Similar to a trombone, will play notes depending on this distance.
Keep hands open to play, close into a fist to cut off sound.
